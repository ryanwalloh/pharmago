## 🔧 **Technical Decisions Made**

### **Inventory Management Strategy**
- **Decision**: Simplified "Is Available" toggle instead of complex stock tracking
- **Reason**: More practical for real-world pharmacy operations
- **Implementation**: Boolean field with optional stock quantity tracking
- **Benefits**: Easier management, real-time updates, flexible for pharmacies

### **Code Organization Strategy**
- **Decision**: Consolidated all inventory models into single `models.py` file
- **Reason**: Simpler architecture, easier maintenance, no circular import issues
- **Implementation**: MedicineCategory, MedicineCatalog, and PharmacyInventory in one file
- **Benefits**: Cleaner imports, unified model management, better developer experience

### **Phase 3.3 Bug Fixes & Code Quality Improvements**
- **Import Error Resolution**: Removed unused `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` import from delivery views
- **Validation Warning Fixes**: Replaced `min_value`/`max_value` with custom validation methods
- **DRF Best Practices**: Implemented proper serializer validation following Django REST framework guidelines
- **Code Consistency**: Standardized validation approach across delivery and payment serializers
- **Zero Functionality Impact**: All fixes were cosmetic/error-resolution only, no business logic changes
