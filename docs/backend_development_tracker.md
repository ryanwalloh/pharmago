## üîß **Technical Decisions Made**

### **Inventory Management Strategy**
- **Decision**: Simplified "Is Available" toggle instead of complex stock tracking
- **Reason**: More practical for real-world pharmacy operations
- **Implementation**: Boolean field with optional stock quantity tracking
- **Benefits**: Easier management, real-time updates, flexible for pharmacies

### **Code Organization Strategy**
- **Decision**: Consolidated all inventory models into single `models.py` file
- **Reason**: Simpler architecture, easier maintenance, no circular import issues
- **Implementation**: MedicineCategory, MedicineCatalog, and PharmacyInventory in one file
- **Benefits**: Cleaner imports, unified model management, better developer experience

---

## üìù **Notes & Decisions**

### **Current Session (Latest)**
- **Consolidated Inventory Models**: Moved all inventory models back to single `models.py` file
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed separate `pharmacy_inventory.py` for cleaner structure
- **Updated Inventory Strategy**: Using simple availability toggle instead of complex stock tracking
- **Recognized Real-world Constraints**: Pharmacy physical store operations vs. online delivery

### **Previous Sessions**
- **Initial Refactoring**: Attempted to separate PharmacyInventory into dedicated file
- **Re-evaluation**: Decided consolidation was better for maintainability
- **Simplified Approach**: Focused on practical pharmacy needs over complex tracking

---
