## üîß **Technical Decisions Made**

### **Inventory Management Strategy**
- **Decision**: Simplified "Is Available" toggle instead of complex stock tracking
- **Reason**: More practical for real-world pharmacy operations
- **Implementation**: Boolean field with optional stock quantity tracking
- **Benefits**: Easier management, real-time updates, flexible for pharmacies

### **Code Organization Strategy**
- **Decision**: Consolidated all inventory models into single `models.py` file
- **Reason**: Simpler architecture, easier maintenance, no circular import issues
- **Implementation**: MedicineCategory, MedicineCatalog, and PharmacyInventory in one file
- **Benefits**: Cleaner imports, unified model management, better developer experience

- **‚úÖ COMPLETED Pharmacy Models**: Complete business verification and management system
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED Order Models**: Full order workflow with delivery integration
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED Delivery Models**: Comprehensive delivery system with order batching
- **Order Batching System**: Smart grouping of nearby orders (max 3) for single rider assignment

- **Real-time Tracking**: RiderLocation model for GPS coordinates and delivery monitoring
- **Business Logic**: OrderBatchingService for intelligent order grouping and rider assignment
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with Rider model in users app, delivery logic in delivery app
- **Phase 1 Progress**: 90% complete - only Payment Models remaining

### **Previous Sessions**
- **Initial Refactoring**: Attempted to separate PharmacyInventory into dedicated file
- **Re-evaluation**: Decided consolidation was better for maintainability
- **Simplified Approach**: Focused on practical pharmacy needs over complex tracking
