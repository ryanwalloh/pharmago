## 🔧 **Technical Decisions Made**

### **Inventory Management Strategy**
- **Decision**: Simplified "Is Available" toggle instead of complex stock tracking
- **Reason**: More practical for real-world pharmacy operations
- **Implementation**: Boolean field with optional stock quantity tracking
- **Benefits**: Easier management, real-time updates, flexible for pharmacies

### **Code Organization Strategy**
- **Decision**: Consolidated all inventory models into single `models.py` file
- **Reason**: Simpler architecture, easier maintenance, no circular import issues
- **Implementation**: MedicineCategory, MedicineCatalog, and PharmacyInventory in one file
- **Benefits**: Cleaner imports, unified model management, better developer experience
